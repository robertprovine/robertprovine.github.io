  <h3>Data-Bot</h3>

  <h3>Hypertext-Control</h3>
  <p>A MIDI CONTROLLED MOCKUP WEBSITE BUILDER, BUILT USING WEBPACK, BABEL, AND EXPRESS.</p>
  <p>Plug in the Behringer X-Touch MIDI controller via usb into the computer, load up the web app and start pushing buttons and turning knobs. In minutes, you'll have yourself a mockup of a fully styled web page that you can download as a starting template before writing a single line of HTML/CSS/JavaScript code.</p>

  <h3>Reaktor Map</h3>
  <p>A REAKTOR SAMPLE MAP FILE GENERATOR.</p>
  <p>Generates a Native Instruments Reaktor sample map file, given a particular folder structure and naming conventions. Development involved reverse engineering the Reaktor sample map file format in a hex editor. It is much quicker to use this generator than to create sample maps manually in Reaktor.</p>
